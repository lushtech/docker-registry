# Step three write a docker-compose.yml and run

```

mkdir  ~/docker-registry/data


cd   ~/docker-registry


touch docker-compose.yml


```




docker-compose.yml

```

registry:
  restart: always
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 5000:5000
  environment:
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: ./certs/domain.crt
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: ./certs/domain.key
    REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd
    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: ./auth/htpasswd
    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry Realm
  volumes:
    - ./data:/var/lib/registry
    - ./certs:/certs
    - ./auth:/auth


```

you must make sure the  right directory which contains the certs/ and auth/ directories.




Start your registry by issuing the following command in the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file:

```
docker-compose up -d


```
