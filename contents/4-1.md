# step one generate your own certificate


* 1. use openssl generate your own certificate

if your host didnot have openssl, you need to install it at first.

```
mkdir  ~/docker-registry/certs

cd ~/docker-registry

openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout certs/domain.key \
  -x509 -days 365 -out certs/domain.crt

```

you must be sure to use the name myregistrydomain.com(for example docker-registry.ucebe.com) as a CN(common name).


After ran the command, you will find two files in ~/docker-registry/certs: domain.crt  domain.key

* 2. Instruct every Docker daemon to trust that certificate. The way to do this depends on your OS.

   * Linux: Copy the domain.crt file to /etc/docker/certs.d/myregistrydomain.com:5000/ca.crt on every Docker host. You do not need to restart Docker.
