# step one generate your own certificate


* 1. use openssl generate your own certificate

if your host didnot have openssl, you need to install it at first.

```
mkdir  ~/docker-registry/certs

cd ~/docker-registry

openssl req \
  -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout certs/domain.key \
  -x509 -days 365 -out certs/domain.crt

```

you must be sure to use the name myregistrydomain.com(for example docker-registry.ucebe.com) as a CN(common name).
