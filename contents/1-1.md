# Docker-compose.yml come from docker official web

[Deploy your registry using a Compose file](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/)

Use the following example docker-compose.yml as a template.

```
registry:
  restart: always
  image: registry:2
  ports:
    - 5000:5000
  environment:
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: /certs/domain.crt #  https certificate
    REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: /certs/domain.key         #  https private key
    REGISTRY_AUTH: htpasswd                          #  a web auth way 
    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH: /auth/htpasswd      #  the path about auth file 
    REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM: Registry Realm     #  the fixed value
  volumes:
    - /path/data:/var/lib/registry                   #  the path for to restore the images 
    - /path/certs:/certs                             #  the https certificate file path
    - /path/auth:/auth                               #  the auth file path 
```

Replace /path with the directory which contains the certs/ and auth/ directories.

Start your registry by issuing the following command in the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file:



```

$ docker-compose up -d

```



**Run an externally-accessible registry,you must first secure it using TLS.**

so you have two way to use TLS:

* one:Get a certificate from a certificate authority (CA).


* two:Use self-signed certificates

[Use self-signed certificates](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/)
