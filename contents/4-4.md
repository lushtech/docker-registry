# Step four: use frpc as a proxy


* 1. Basic  situation
  
    * you have setup a frps server

    * you will use docker-registry.ucebe.com

* 2. the docker-images frpc.ini and the docker-registry.yml


     * docker-images

       you can use the docker-images frpc:0.23.2

       see the details from lushtech/frp-vpn-server-client.git

     * frpc.ini
```
