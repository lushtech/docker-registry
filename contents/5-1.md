## In rancher

### first you need to add a registry

* 1.From the Global view, select the project containing the namespace(s) where you want to add a registry.

* 2.From the main menu, select Resources > Registries. Click Add Registry.

* 3.Enter a Name for the registry.


Note:
Kubernetes classifies secrets, certificates, ConfigMaps, and registries all as secrets, and no two secrets 

in a project or namespace can have duplicate names. Therefore, to prevent conflicts, your registry must 

have a unique name among all secrets within your workspace.


* 4.Select a Scope for the registry. You can either make the registry available for the entire project or a single namespace.

* 5.Select the website that hosts your private registry. Then enter credentials that authenticate with the registry.

* 6.Click Save.

Result: Your secret is added to the project or namespace, depending on the scope you chose. You can view the secret in the Rancher UI from the Resources > Registries view.



note: Another chose, you also can create it using kubectl:


在racher服务器上的kubectl命令行界面运行：
```
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred --docker-server=https://docker-registry.ucebe.com --docker-username=testuser --docker-password=testpassword --docker-email=lushatech@163.com

# 运行成功出现以下信息
#secret "regcred" created


```






### But if you have two registry in one namespace, you need to add one filed
### in the depoly.yml file manually to instruct you will use which registory, or it will show error registry authentication: "no basic auth credentials" .



```

imagePullSecrets:

   - name: regsecret
   
```


the “regseret” is your registry name, you can change it.


the error message exactly is like:

```
ErrImagePull: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: Get https://docker-registry.ucebe.com/v2/my-frpc-docker/manifests/latest: no basic auth credentials


```
